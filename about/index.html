      <h1>About Marco</h1>
    </header>

    <p>A solutions and software engineer, currently working for VMware.</p>
<p>I am into Cloud technologies, especially Hybrid Cloud and DevOps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hybrid Cloud &amp; Multi Cloud</li>
<li>Kubernetes</li>
<li>CI/CD</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="passionate-about-business-and-numbers">Passionate About Business and Numbers</h2>
<p>I have run a couple of businesses when working as a software engineer for 6+ years.</p>
<ul>
<li>Online Coding Education Platform</li>
<li>IT Consulting</li>
</ul>
<p>And this is why I decided to become a solutions engineer. I always wanted to have a wider view of business, but as a software engineer, I always felt the chance was very limited. I wanted to face customers and to understand why they buy products and how to convince them to choose right ones.</p>
<h2 id="passionate-about-technologies">Passionate About Technologies</h2>
<p>As a full-stack software engineer, I did:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Engineering</li>
<li>Data Visualization</li>
<li>JS, Scala, Python, Go</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="more">More</h2>
<p>I am originally from Korea and currently living in Singapore with my sweet wife and a baby boy ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ If you know how to read Korean, you can find <a href="https://brunch.co.kr/@imagineer">my articles in Brunch</a> and <a href="https://book.naver.com/bookdb/book_detail.nhn?bid=14257826">my book, &ldquo;A Historian Became A Devloper&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
