      <description>A solutions and software engineer, currently working for VMware.
I am into Cloud technologies, especially Hybrid Cloud and DevOps:
 Hybrid Cloud &amp;amp; Multi Cloud Kubernetes CI/CD  Passionate About Business and Numbers I have run a couple of businesses when working as a software engineer for 6+ years.
 Online Coding Education Platform IT Consulting  And this is why I decided to become a solutions engineer. I always wanted to have a wider view of business, but as a software engineer, I always felt the chance was very limited.</description>
