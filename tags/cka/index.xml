      <description>What is Kubernetes? When I first learned programming, it was not very difficult to build an application. There were a lot of useful resources to use for application development. (Developers like sharing.) If you have chosen right courses, then it took a couple of weeks to build what you wanted. But a real problem was deployment. You can learn programming on your laptop, but it was not easy learn application deployment and maintanance on your machine.</description>
