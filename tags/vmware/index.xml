      <description>What is Homelab? I have used many public cloud services for a while. Since I started my career as a software engineer, AWS was already quite popular. Some old developer folks might not have chance to use public cloud services when landing on their first job, but I was lucky. So I used AWS in my first company. I have used AWS, GCP, Firebase for most of my careers.
But I always wanted to have my own home data center, which is a homelab.</description>
