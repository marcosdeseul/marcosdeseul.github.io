      <description>What is vSAN? Have you heard of HCI, Hyper Converged Infrastructure? It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I joined VMware. I still feel that the term HCI is too fancy and not very intuitive. But it is not a fault of VMware because VMware is not the one who invented the term.
Hyper Converged Infrastructure usually means server computers with internal shared storages. What? When we use a laptop or a desktop, it usually comes with storage inside, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?</description>

      <description>What is vSphere? I believe that you already know what vSphere is if you visit this post. Since VMware vSphere is the most popular server virtualization product, so if you are in the IT infrastructure industry, you must have heard of vSphere once at leat. But just in case someone visits this blog to learn about VMware and its products, I would like to describe what vSphere is.
Before talking about what vSphere is, we need to know what a hypervisor is.</description>

      <description>What is Homelab? I have used many public cloud services for a while. Since I started my career as a software engineer, AWS was already quite popular. Some old developer folks might not have chance to use public cloud services when landing on their first job, but I was lucky. So I used AWS in my first company. I have used AWS, GCP, Firebase for most of my careers.
But I always wanted to have my own home data center, which is a homelab.</description>
