      <description>What is NSX Data Center? You always use Network to access to the Internet. If you didn&amp;rsquo;t go to a place without Internet connection like an island, you are technically living with Networks; Wifi, mobile cellular data, routers to provide wifi at home, etc.
But I had not thought of Network as a computing resource before joining VMware. Even my previous company was one of wireless network hardware vendor, Ruckus Network, but my exposure to Networking was limited.</description>

      <description>What is vSAN? Have you heard of HCI, Hyper Converged Infrastructure? It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I joined VMware. I still feel that the term HCI is too fancy and not very intuitive. But it is not a fault of VMware because VMware is not the one who invented the term.
Hyper Converged Infrastructure usually means server computers with internal shared storages. What? When we use a laptop or a desktop, it usually comes with storage inside, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?</description>

      <description>What is vSphere? I believe that you already know what vSphere is if you visit this post. Since VMware vSphere is the most popular server virtualization product, so if you are in the IT infrastructure industry, you must have heard of vSphere once at leat. But just in case someone visits this blog to learn about VMware and its products, I would like to describe what vSphere is.
Before talking about what vSphere is, we need to know what a hypervisor is.</description>
